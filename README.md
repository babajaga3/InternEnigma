### Deprecated - Bot is out of order, server no longer uses it/ hasn't been updated ###

Hello there fellow GitHub traveler who is opening this file! This is a README file that explains the ins and outs of the bot (files):

#### IMPORTANT ####
- I greatly advise making a `CHANGELOG.md` to keep track of changes.
- DON'T FORGET TO DO `npm install`

Go nuts!

**COMMAND HANDLER & EVENT HANDLER**

This bot uses a ~custom~ command that can handle lots of common things like a cooldown, permissions etc. More info in ***./src/utils/structures/BaseCommand.js***. The Event Handler and the Command Handler work the same way, so I won't be explaining again in the ***BaseEvent.js***.
